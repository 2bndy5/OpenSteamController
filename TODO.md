# Open Steam Controller TODO

The intent of this document is to outline the goals of this project at the
 highest level. Further details can be found in the TODO documents for each
 Subproject linked below.


# Goals

At this point the Open Steam Controller Project has reached a point of initial
 capability and stability. There are examples of custom firmware running
 running on the main processor. Jingles can be fully customized. Reverse 
 Engineering has mapped a lot of details on how the official firmware works
 and has uncovered some unused features. 

Moving forward there are two potential priorities:
* More custom [Firmware](./Firmware/)
* Easier to use [Jingle Customization](./Jingle/)


# Subproject TODOs

## Firmware

See [TODO](./Firmware/TODO.md) for details on TODOs related to custom firmware
 that has or could be created for the Steam Controller.

## Jingle

See [TODO](./Jingle/TODO.md) for details on TODOs related to the ability to
 fully customize the Jingles the Steam Controller plays at power up and 
 power off.

## Reverse Engineering

See [TODO](./ReverseEngineering/TODO.md) for details on TODOs related to 
 understanding how the official firmware works and documentation of these
 capabilities and details related to the hardware.

## USB Configuration

See [TODO](./UsbConfiguration/TODO.md) for details on TODOs related to
 documenting and using the USB communications protocol implemented by the
 official Steam Controller Firmware.
