		//	if CT32B1 interrupt occurs this causes a heap space variable (0x100007e4 - 0x100007e7) to be incremented
		//	However, this variable can be incremented (seemingly) forever with no affect
		//	My thought is that clues lies in simulating other exceptions (i.e. USB IRQ, PendSV, SysTick, SVCall)
		//	FOCUS: Where are the following heap addresses modified? 0x10000200, 0x10000244, 0x1000025d
		//	ALSO: Keep an eye out for where 0x100007e4 - 0x100007e7 is read and may cause system to shutdown if it gets greater than some value or something
	}

	//TODO: Remember to pay attention to branches/paths simulation does and does not take.
	//TODO: Keep in mind that system will continue after WFI. Need to walk through this simulation and see about options (how does controller shutdown...?)
	//		I think what happens is that WFI is called for interrupt to run that sets particular registers. 
	//		Maybe 32 bit timer interrupting before other things happening causes variables to get set in a way such that power off occurs
	//		Otherwise controller might stay in this "idle" loop, or go into other "idle" loop, waiting for shutdown signal?
