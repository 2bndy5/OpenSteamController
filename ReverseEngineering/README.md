The work in this directory focuses on deconstructing the firmware and hardware
 of the Steam Controller. The understanding gained from this is the basis for
 the other work being done in this project.

#### [Generating .bin file](https://community.nxp.com/thread/389005)

Note that in a new project under Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Build Steps -> Post-build steps, 
 the commands necessary to generate a bin file exist, but are commented out by
 default.

#### .bin File Layout

* Starts with vector table
    * From 20.7 of UM10462: The reserved ARM Cortex-M0 exception vector location 7 (offset 0x0000 001C in the vector table) should contain the 2â€™s complement of the check-sum of table entries 0 through 6. This causes the checksum of the first 8 table entries to be 0. The bootloader code checksums the first 8 locations in sector 0 of the flash. If the result is 0, then execution control is transferred to the user code.

* See Section 24.3.3.4 (Fig 24-80) of UM10462 for layout of vector table
    * 0x0000 00004 - Entry point to code in ARM Cortex-M0 vector table. See 20.15.1 of UM10462
    * 0x0000 0001C - Vector location 7. Must contain 2's complement of vector table entries 0-6. See 20.7 or UM10462

* Endianness
    * Certain sections default to little endian
    * Other sections are configurable
        * TODO: Where is this stated in UM10462? And what are these sections? Is this important?

#### [LPC Image Checksums](https://community.nxp.com/thread/389046)

Note that in a new project under Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Build Steps -> Post-build steps, 
 the commands necessary to generate a checksum for a bin file exist, but are commented out by
 default.

* Checksum is stored at 0x1C for Cortex-M based parts
    * checksum -p ${TargetChip} -d "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin"
* This checksum is calculated from the contents of the vector table, not the whole image (probably why I got away with chaning USB info strings)
    * For more details please see the user manual for the MCU that you are using.

# Disassembling the LPC11U37 Firwmare

This section details the approaches attempted and used to disassemble the 
 Steam Controller firmware. 

## [pinkySim](https://github.com/greggersaurus/pinkySim)

This is main method used for simulating the firmware. 

* Note: Need to use "make pinkySim" as building unit tests fails...
    * TODO: get to bottom of this.
* ARMv6-M Thumb instruction simulator.
* Forked and working on custom functionality.
    * Logging (--logExe chipType)
        * Creates csv log of all instructions and memory accesses executed during simulation.
        * Added memory table specific to LPC11U37, which would be confusing if logging for a different chip.
            * TODO: Think of how to do this better? chip specified as command line arg?
    * Disassembly
        * TODO: Worth spending time on option to out asm after running simulation? (will only cover instructions that were executed during sim)
* Using gdb installed by LPCXpresso IDE (On OSX: /Applications/lpcxpresso_8.2.2_650/lpcxpresso/tools/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb) to connect to simulator

### Simulation Steps

#### Launch Simulator 

The following command launches the emulator with the proper memory map for the 
 LPC11U37F501, has the emulator halt on the first instruction to execute after
 reset and instructs pinkySim to log all instructions executed to a file named
 exeLog{datetimestmap}.csv.

* ./pinkySim --breakOnStart --logExe LPC11U37 --flash 0 131072 --ram 268435456 8192 --ram 536805376 16384 --ram 536870912 2048 --ram 536887296 2048 --ram 1073741824 16384 --ram 1073758208 16384 --ram 1073774592 16384 --ram 1073790976 16384 --ram 1073807360 16384 --ram 1073823744 16384 --ram 1073840128 16384 --ram 1073856512 16384 --ram 1073971200 16384 --ram 1073987584 16384 --ram 1074003968 16384 --ram 1074020352 16384 --ram 1074036736 16384 --ram 1074053120 16384 --ram 1074102272 16384 --ram 1074118656 16384 --ram 1074135040 16384 --ram 1074266112 16384 --ram 1342177280 16484 --ram 3758096384 1048576 firmware.bin
    * Note: --ram 536805376 16384 --flash, but since we need to fill this ROM with the boot ROM code via gdb, this needs to be writable

#### Connect to Simulator

The following command launches gbd (installed by LPCXpresso IDE on OSX at /Applications/lpcxpresso_8.2.2_650/lpcxpresso/tools/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb), attaches it to the running emulator and sets up register to values to desired states:

* ./gdb -ex "source -v gdbCmdFile"
    * See comments in gdbCmd file for details on what it is doing (and can be configured to do)
    * A binary file named LPC11U3x16kBbootROM.bin is expected to exist (in current directory). The file should contain the binary dump of 0x1FFF0000 to 0x1FFF4000 from an LPC11U37.
        * This can be obtained from a Steam Controller using custom firmware from [Development Board](../DevBoard) project to peek at the 16 kB boot ROM.

* TODO: incorporate the following into gdbCmdFile via local variables (if possible):
    * Execute "continue" to start simulation.
    * Will need to break (ctrl-c) and execute command "set {int}0x40010008 = 0" to get simulation past waiting for 16-bit counter/timer 1.
        * User can tell this needs to happen when instructions 0x61a, 0x61c, 0x61e repeat non-stop.
    * Simulation will end with 0xa6e as last valid instruction.
        * Next instruction is Wait for Interrupt (WFI), which pinkySim simulator reports as Unsupported Instruction.
    * TODO: What about 0x40048030 and brown-out detect?
    * TODO: What about 0x10000258 and setting to 8 to indicate proper hw (after EEPROM "read")?
    * TODO: What about USB voltage detect?

### Simulation Details

This section details different paths from which we may want to simulate the firmware.

[vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.c](./vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.c) is an attempt to turn the simulation results
 into C code with, at least some of, the same functionality as the vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.bin firmware.

#### Initialization

By default, simulation starts at instruction specified via Vector Table RESET entry point.
 
Simulation is allowed to run with minimal intervention (i.e. loops waiting for
 PLLs to lock or other hardware reactions are simulated as needed, pauses are
 made to adjust values "read" from EEPROM). 

Uknown paths are identified to be revisisted lated with further stimuli to
 simulation runs. These are being marked by TODO: UNKOWN PATHS.

Attempts are made being made to identify SRAM0 memory usage.

#### Exceptions 

This section details attempts to simulate certain exception paths. This is being 
 pursued as Reset/Init path eventually called WFI instruction. This implies
 interrupts occurring is a necessary part of system boot (i.e. either successful
 connection or shutdown due to connectin timeout).

Simulating an exception can be achieved by setting the PC register to the 
 instruction specified in the Vector Table. However, keep in mind the nuances
 of how IRQ actually work and that simply setting the PC will allow you to 
 simulate the interrupt accurately, but may be desctructive in terms of picking 
 back up where the main thread code was interrupted. 

According to 24.3.3.6.1 xPSR, PC, LR, R12, R3, R2, R1 and R0 are saved upon
 interrupt and restored upon exit. Save and restore these values if you want to
 pick up the main thread after simulating an interrupt.

Also, according 24.3.3.6.1 LR is set to EXC_RETURN upon interrupt entry. Thus a
 bx to LR (assuming no further stack pushes (without matching pops) to change 
 LR), will indicate an interrupt exit. In short, set LR to a know instruction 
 (maybe a WFI instruction or something that will cause an emulator break) before
 changing the PC to the interrupt handler so that you know when the interrupt 
 handler is exiting.

## FirmwareParser.py

This is only being used to display the Vector Table.

Original idea was to create disassembler that can recreate assembly file, 
distinguishing data versus instructions by evaulating code and all possible
branches. 

In the end this was a larger undertaking than expected. It would make more 
sense to leverage pinkySim's ability to decode instructions and their 
behavior to do this, as opposed to starting from scratch.

## [Radare](http://www.radare.org/r/)

This proved to not be particularly useful for raw stripped binary.

* [Steep learning curve](https://www.gitbook.com/book/radare/radare2book/details)
* Has option to disassemble ARM, but how exactly does it handle ARMv6-M?
    * Does not automatically work with firmware.bin as input
    * What about #if 0  section iwth armv6 options?
* With have firmware binary format (i.e. no code/data sections information) this only helps so much. 
    * Simulation with pinkySim can be utilized to possibly rebuild this section information and then revisit this tool?
