# TODO

These items relate to a better understanding of the [USB Communications](./) with
 the official Steam Controller Firmware. The hope/thought/dream is that this
 might help to improve other Subprojects such as the Jingle Customization:

* Work through reverse engineering to see if there is a USB command to allow for modifying EEPROM already exists
    * Could eliminate step of switching firmware when customizing EEPROM Jingle Data
